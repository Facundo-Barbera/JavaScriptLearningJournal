#Hello world.

Welcome to my first learning journal for JavaScript.
I took a course some time ago for JavaScript but to be honest I didn't put the interest necessary to learn it.

So to keep myself on track this time, I want to kind of journal everything together.

##First part: The hello world.

JavaScript's hello world is... Different from other languages.
This seems obvious, since all languages are different, but when talking about JS,
there's a couple of ways you can go about actually using it.

I will try to keep files in a way that you can use them in any web-browser.

Additionally, I will be coding in WebStorm.

##The learning journal.

All the docs from this project regarding learning processes will have this section.
In this section I will include what I learnt.

On this file I learnt how to add scripts to an HTML file and use a browser console to output some text.

I created a small JavaScript file:
```js
console.log("Hello World!")
```

And invoked it in the HTML page inside the body:
```html 
<!-- load the JS file. -->
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

I also learnt that I can use node.js to execute the JavaScript code independently.
Cool.
